In this project, the goal is to create a machine learning model for predicting house prices by leveraging the power of Python, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow. The project involves collecting and preprocessing a dataset containing relevant features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, and other influential factors. Scikit-learn will be employed for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and the initial model development. TensorFlow, a powerful open-source machine learning framework, will then be utilized to construct a more sophisticated and fine-tuned model, possibly incorporating neural networks for improved predictive accuracy. The process will include data splitting for training and testing, model training, evaluation, and fine-tuning to optimize performance. Through this project, the aim is to develop a robust and accurate machine learning model capable of predicting house prices, providing valuable insights for real estate stakeholders and prospective buyers.
